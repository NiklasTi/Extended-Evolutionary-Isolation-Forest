# Extended Evolutionary Isolation Forest

 This is the code to the master thesis extended evolutionary isolation forest.
 In this git, no data sets are provided, so a user needs to download these themselves. The ODDS data used for the thesis can be found under http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/ and the 
 Yahoo Webscope data can be requested at https://webscope.sandbox.yahoo.com/catalog.php?datatype=s&did=70

 To run the code, open tester.py, adjust the data set as needed and run tester.py.
 Parameters that can be easily adjusted in tester.py are iterations and threshold for anomaly scores.
 The further parameters can be adjusted in EEIF.py and extended_iForest.py
 
 The results will be saved as a .csv in the results folder.
