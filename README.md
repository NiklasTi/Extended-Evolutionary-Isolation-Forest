# This is the code to the master thesis extended evolutionary isolation forest.
#
 In this git, no data sets are provided, so a user needs to download these themselves. The data used for the thesis can be found under http://odds.cs.stonybrook.edu/

 To run the code, open tester.py and adjust the data set as needed.
 Parameters that can be easily adjusted in the tester.py are iteration and threshold for anomaly scores.
 The further parameters can be adjusted in EEIF.py and extended_iForest.py 

 Code for the WTG experiments are not provided in this reposititory.
